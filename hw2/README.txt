To run the udp server program, you must type 'python server_python_udp.py'. To run the tcp server program, you must type 'python server_python_tcp.py'. To run the udp client program, you must type 'python client_python_udp.py'. To run the tcp client program, you mudt type 'python client_python_tcp.py'. Make sure to run the server program before running the client program. Once the client program is running, enter a string of numbers and press "enter". The server will compute the addition of all of the numbers and send the result back, which will be printed to stdout. The server continues to compute the sum of all of the numbers until the sum is only 1 digit in length, then the connection is closed and the program exits. If the input does not contain only numbers, then the server will send back a message saying that it can't compute the sum, the connection will be closed, and the program will exit.

**Potential Problems***
The only potential problems with these programs are:
1. Sometimes you have to wait after tcpserver closes the connection in order t o run it again or else there is an error. Also, when tcpserver and tcp client are running, tcpclient will sometimes print multiple responses on the same line, but other times it will print the responses perfectly. Given the inconsistency, it is hard to track down exactly why this is happening.
