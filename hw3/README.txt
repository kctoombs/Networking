To begin this assignment, I decided to use a cs.ucsb.edu email to send the email to. I did an NS lookup to determine the name of the mail server for the domain cs.ucsb.edu, and once I discovered the name of the server I pinged it to determine its IP. This IP was hard coded into the program. Next, I established a TCP connection with the mail server using Mehmet's slides from section as a reference. I looked over the provided code from the "Read greeting from the server" and the "Send HELO command and get server response" sections in order to figure out what to do in the remaining sections. It was fairly simple once I understood what the provided code was doing because the code was very similar for each command. Essentially in every step, I send specific information to the server formatted in the correct way, then I read in the response from the server, and I verify that the response was received. The messages that are being sent to and received from the server are also written to stdout. It is important to clear the sendline and recvline arrays after using them and when preparing to use them for a new command.

One problem I had when writing this program was that I would initially be sending empty commands to the server. I would receive errors back from the server saying "command not recognized "" " meaning that it was either not receiving the command or it was receiving empty commands.  I fixed this by replacing   "write(sockfd, sender_address, MAXLINE);" with   write(sockfd, sender_address, strlen(sender_address));
